Some down sides would be that the top floor is closed for staff or artists, I believe, and I think that if the public was able to go to the top floor we would have a great view. The major down side for me was that it was audio based information guided tour from your phone, and the audio only went over a few details and some major highlights while I really wanted to know more details which was also a bummer for us because we both had low battery going to the museum."

It's not a traditional museum in many ways, but just walking room to room with the audio guide was a great time. The individual items in the collection aren't labeled, but they are meticulously cataloged on their website which made it easy to look up any pieces I wanted to know more about."

Great temporary exhibitions! This time we visited "Claude Monet and Boston" and sculptures in the ancient Egypt. I got to see rare Monet's paintings that I only have seen in books. The presentation and set up was incredibly interesting and gave lots of information!`
